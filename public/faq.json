    "question": "How does it work? ",
    "answer": "Our product is Digital Smart Business Card. Our cards have a built-in NFC chip. When you purchase a card, you have to create a profile. In your profile you may include name, designation, company name, website, social media links, address, email, phone number, profile picture etc.Once the profile is set your card is ready to use. Whenever you want to share your contact information with someone, just tap the card with his/her smartphone and your profile will show up on their screen. The other person does not need any app. They can then save your contact information and also send their contact information in your email.You can change your profile information anytime. The tap function only works with NFC enabled smartphones. If a smartphone does not have NFC then QR Code will work the same way."
